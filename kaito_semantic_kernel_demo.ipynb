    "\n",
    "This notebook is a simple demonstration of how to use the [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/overview/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003203) with [Kaito](https://github.com/Azure/kaito). There is currently no official Kaito connector available for the Semantic Kernel, so we have developed our own. You can find the source code for the connector in the `kaito` directory in this repository.\n",
